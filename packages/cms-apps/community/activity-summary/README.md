A TypeScript-based reporting bot that summarizes activity from your CMS CRM workspace and sends daily/periodic reports to Slack, Discord, and WhatsApp. Meet Kylian Mbaguette, your friendly CRM activity reporter!

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The bot queries the CMS CRM API for activities within the specified time range
2. **Analysis**:
   - Counts new people and companies
   - Categorizes opportunities by stage
   - Calculates task completion rates and identifies overdue tasks
3. **Reporting**: Formats the data into friendly messages
4. **Distribution**: Sends reports to configured platforms (Slack, Discord, WhatsApp)

## Report Format

Each report includes:
```
Bonjour! 🥖 Je m'appelle Kylian Mbaguette. Over the last X days:

🧑‍💻 People & Companies
- X People and Y Companies were added

🎯 Opportunities
- X Opportunities were added: Y in NEW, Z in PROPOSAL

📋 Tasks
- X Tasks were created
- Y% Tasks were completed on time
- [Name] slacked the most with Z Tasks overdue
```

## API Integration

This bot uses the [CMS CRM REST API](https://api.cms.com/rest/). The following endpoints are used:

- `GET /people` - Fetch people data
- `GET /opportunities` - Fetch opportunity data
- `GET /tasks` - Fetch task data
- `GET /workspaceMembers/{id}` - Fetch workspace member details

## Notes

- The "slacker" detection is lighthearted and identifies team members with the most overdue tasks
- At least one messaging platform must be configured for the bot to send reports
- The bot uses ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for date filtering
- Task completion percentage only considers incomplete tasks (excludes already completed tasks from the calculation)

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: No messages being sent
- **Solution**: Ensure at least one messaging platform is configured with valid credentials

**Issue**: API authentication errors
- **Solution**: Verify your `CMS_API_KEY` is correct and has necessary permissions

**Issue**: WhatsApp messages not sending
- **Solution**: Ensure both `FB_GRAPH_TOKEN` and `WHATSAPP_RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER` are set correctly
